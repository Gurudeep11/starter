## Welcome

There are two ways to access the API's listed: 
1. Using [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Using [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The Database where the requests are sent and response are received is from MongoDb. In this documentation we are going to document how different API's can be accessed using Python.
