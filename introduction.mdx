**<span style={{ color: "#008D9C" }}>RLEF</span>**, short for **<span style={{ color: "#008D9C" }}>"Reinforcement Learning with Expert Feedback"</span>**, is a dashboard designed to enhance model performance by integrating human expertise in various domains. Its development stemmed from the challenge of understanding the data and methodologies employed by machine learning experts, thereby necessitating a tool like RLEF to provide visibility into the data utilized for model training.

The dashboard is structured into three key sections: **<span style={{ color: "#008D9C" }}>Data</span>**, **<span style={{ color: "#008D9C" }}>Models</span>**, and **<span style={{ color: "#008D9C" }}>Configuration</span>**. Upon accessing the dashboard, users encounter project listings showcasing the various tasks undertaken by the Techolution Team in collaboration with clients. These tasks encompass a range of activities such as audio processing, video annotation, image analysis, text comprehension, and more.

Within each task, users can track the progress of data through different stages: from Backlog, where new data is uploaded, to Approval, where it undergoes annotation and review, and finally to Approved, once verified by domain experts. Additionally, users can create distinct data collections from approved datasets for model training and evaluation.
The Models section facilitates model training and testing, providing insights into model performance and analytics. Users can monitor ongoing training processes and assess model effectiveness through testing on various datasets.
Configuration options enable users to customize models for specific tasks by defining parameters and architectures. They can also expand label categories and establish label mappings for enhanced classification accuracy.
RLEF's features include DataBoost for reinforcing misclassified data, AI Assisted Labeling to streamline data annotation, and Copilots for automated data annotation and error analysis.
In summary, RLEF serves as a comprehensive platform for optimizing machine learning models through human expertise integration, streamlined data management, and customizable model configurations, paving the way for future advancements in AI-driven solutions.
